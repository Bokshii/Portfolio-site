                <h3>Questioning My Life</h3>
                <span class="exp-date">Present</span>
                <p>Just here wondering what I’m doing with my life, while typing away and figuring out the next move. If you need someone to overthink everything, I’m your go-to!</p>
              </div>

            <h3>Graphic Designer Intern</h3>
            <span class="exp-date">2025 (6 months)</span>
            <p>Got hired to make things look “aesthetic.” Ended up deep in Photoshop layers questioning reality. Designed logos, posters, and social media stuff while trying not to crash Illustrator every 10 minutes. Accidentally became the “design guy,” survived on Ctrl+Z and vibes.</p>

            <h3>Photographer & Designer</h3>
            <span class="exp-date">2019-2025</span>
            <p>Took photos, added way too many filters, and spent hours making tiny changes that nobody cares about. Created designs that made people go “Wow”... or maybe just “Meh.” Spent my days questioning my life choices while pretending to be a Photoshop wizard.</p>

          <div class="experience-item">
            <h3>Data Entry Specialist</h3>
            <span class="exp-date">2015-2018</span>
            <p>Turned messy handwritten notes on old, torn paper into neat, organized data. Became a pro at reading bad handwriting and making sense of it. Learned to type super fast while trying not to lose my mind. Spent more time with spreadsheets than I’d like to admit.</p>

            <h3>Home Tutor</h3>
            <span class="exp-date">2014-2015</span>
            <p>Taught students the basics of computer science. Helped them get a grip on coding and made learning feel less like a boring task and more like solving puzzles. You know, making sure they understood the logic without getting lost in the techy stuff.</p>
